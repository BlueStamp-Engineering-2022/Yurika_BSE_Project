# Music Synthesizer
Make a Magical Music Machine by building your own MIDI controller!                                                   
My audio synthesizer is a physical interface that uses MIDI (Musical Interface Digital Interface) to play sounds & ultimately make music.

# Second Milestone
Milestone two is the hardware. To assemble the box together, I first produced a detailed and accurate mechanical drawing with dimensions. I then drilled into my enclosure using 1 inch drill bits. I filed down the sides of the holes and popped the buttons & potentiometers in. After securing the buttons and potentiometers to my enclosure, I began on wiring and soldering my circuit. I soldered wires to my buttons & potentiometers, then An Arduino Micro on a breadboard is connected to my computer with Garageband open. I really enjoyed learning how to drill, saw, solder, & gained very useful hardware skills. When I tested my assembled device, I ran into a problem: the buttons would not play sounds invidually, they would only play a sound when all of them were pressed. The potentiometers also were very inconsistent & one would only work to control the volume. I triple checked my wiring, soldering, assembly, code, and everything I've done to that point. I asked every instructor to help find the error and they helped with conducting tests to trouble shoot. I walked into every classroom, asking other students with similar projects on what they did. I spent most of my days frustratingly retracing my steps & trouble shooting & asking for another set of eyes. After weeks, an instructor found that it was the breadboard that had disconnected parts, making my project faulty. I've never felt so happy in my life! After wiring the breadboard together so that it was all connected, my MIDI controller worked perfectly.

# First Milestone 
Milestone one is to test the functionality of one button through wiring it to an arduino, in order to familiarize with the wiring process of the controller. I connected a wire from ground to the negative side of the breadboard, then used alligator clips to securely connect the wires to the button. I uploaded a code that turns the LED light on when the button is pressed. Now that I know that the buttons work, the next step would be to test the button's functionality in relation to MIDI, so that pressing the button would initate a sound to be played. After a lot of debugging & trouble shooting, I was able to play sounds from Garageband by pressing a button.

# Starter Project
Simon Says Game is a fun game where the player attempts to replicate lighting patterns of the game. Through-hole components allowed me to easily solder on the resistor, microcontroller, capacitors, LEDs, buzzer, switches, and battery clips. I initially struggled to solder on components with accuracy, but with practice, I became very comfortable with soldering. Now, I love to solder whenever I get the chance to. When my game was not working due to unconnected components, I learned that it is very crucial to stay patient instead of messily rushing. After trouble shooting by double checking component by component, I found a disconnected portion on my circuit board. The game then worked! My starter project was greatly informing & exciting, and its button aspect would be a prominent aspect of my main project.
