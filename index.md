# Audio Synthesizer
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Starter Project
Simon Says Game is a fun game where the player attempts to replicate lighting patterns of the game. Through-hole components allowed me to easily solder on the battery clips, switches, LEDs, resistor, capacitors, These are the batteries, which power the game. There are four buttons which light up with leds behind them. There is also a power switch to turn the game on and off. There is another switch to turn the sound on and off. With the through hole components, I was able to easily solder on the resistor, capacitors, microcontroller, buzzer, LEDs, battery clips, and slide switches into the PCB. Let’s play this game! – I really enjoyed this project because it is very beginner friendly and approachable. I struggled on making the game work, since I forgot to solder in the battery clips. After going through each component of my project, I found that the circuit wasn’t connected to the power source and fixed my problem. This project was very enjoyable. Thank you for watching.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.
